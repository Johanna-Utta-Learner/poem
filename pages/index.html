            <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name's Jo. If you're interested in poetry, especially French poets, then have a look round my site. </p>
            <p>This is a fan girl site for Andree Chedid, a poet I knew nothing about a month ago. I'm going to use this portfolio project to collect some of her poems, thoughts and anything else I'm loving right now.</p>
            <p>Oh and yes, this site is also a dedication to Pantone colour of the year and I'm going to have some fun with colour but I'll try not to go overboard.
            <p>Andree Chedid famously said that her work was a quest for humanity.  I can't claim anything so noble but maybe this project will help me leave the matrix every once in a while.</p>

                D'abord,
                Efface ton nom
                Abolis ton âge
                Supprime tes lieux
                Déracine ce que tu sembles
                Qui reste debout ?
                Maintenant,
                Ressaisis ton nom
                Revêts ton âge
                Adopte ta maison
                Pénètre ta marche
                Et puis…
                À n'en plus finir,
                Recommence ?
            </pre>

            <p>Andree Chedid was profilic, she wrote poetry, novels and theatre plays.  She was a celebrated poet in her lifetime in France and very popular with children.  Many French primary schools carry her name.</p>
