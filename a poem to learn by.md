Learn with a poem
Learn with a poem
He said, "learn with a poem."
Ok, I'll learn with a poem, that's enough now, I'm saying goodbye, yes I said I would learn with a poem.


I'm feeling very blue
I am a unicorn
I'm feeling very green
I have an interview
Where I will be seen.

Elle est retrouvée.
Quoi? -L’Eternité.
C’est la mer allée
Avec le soleil.
